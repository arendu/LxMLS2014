This exercise will show you that real-world sentences can have complicated syntactic structures. There is a
parse tree visualizer in http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/treeviz/. Go to your local data/treebanks folder
and open the file PTB excerpt.txt. Copy a few trees from the file, one at a time, and examine their parse trees in the
visualizer.
